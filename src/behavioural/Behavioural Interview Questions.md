**Tell me about a time when you faced a conflict within your team. How did you resolve it during solutioning?**

**Answer:**
During my time at Oracle, while working on the GBU Analytics Cloud Service project, we faced a conflict during the solutioning phase regarding the choice of technology for handling multi-tenant authentication and authorization. Some team members advocated for using Spring Security OAuth2, while others preferred a custom-built solution, arguing that it would offer more flexibility and control.

The conflict arose because both approaches had their pros and cons. The Spring Security OAuth2 solution was well-documented and widely used, but some team members felt it might not fully meet our specific requirements for multi-tenancy. On the other hand, building a custom solution would give us more control but would require significant development effort and could introduce risks if not implemented correctly.

To resolve the conflict, I took the initiative to facilitate a team meeting where everyone could present their viewpoints. I encouraged open discussion and asked each team member to outline the benefits and drawbacks of their preferred approach. After listening to both sides, I suggested that we conduct a proof of concept (PoC) for both solutions.

We divided the team into two smaller groups, with each group working on a PoC for one of the approaches. After a week, we reconvened to review the results. The PoC for Spring Security OAuth2 demonstrated that it could meet our requirements with some customization, while the custom solution required more time and resources than we had available.

Based on the PoC results, we collectively decided to proceed with Spring Security OAuth2, as it provided a balance between meeting our requirements and minimizing development effort. To address the concerns about flexibility, I proposed a plan to extend the Spring Security framework with custom components where needed.

This approach not only resolved the conflict but also ensured that the team was aligned and committed to the chosen solution. By fostering collaboration and focusing on data-driven decision-making, we were able to move forward with the project successfully.
