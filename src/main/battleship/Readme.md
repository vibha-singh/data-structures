Below problem statement was given to me and expectation was to come up with a proper working code for it.
BattleShip Game
Design and implement a battleship game to be played between two players until one comes out
as the winner.

Requirements:
● The game will be played in a square area of the sea with NxN grids which will be called
a battlefield. “N” should be taken as input in your code.
● The battlefield will be divided in half between both the players. So in a NxN battlefield,
NxN/2 grids will belong to PlayerA and the other NxN/2 grids will belong to playerB
● The size and location of each ship will be taken as input. Each ship will be assumed to
be of Square shape. Both the players should be assigned equal fleet.
● The location of each ship in the NxN grids has to be taken as input (X, Y). X and Y
should be integers. For eg. if a ship “SH1” is at (2, 2) and has the size of 4, its corners
will be at (0, 0), (0, 4), (4, 0) and (4,4)
● Ships will remain stationary. No two ships should overlap with each other. However they
can touch boundaries with each other.
● Each player will fire one missile towards the enemy field during his turn using the
“random coordinate fire” strategy, which means the missile will hit at a random
coordinate of the opponent’s field. It might hit or miss the opponent ship. In either case
the turn is then transferred to the other player.
○ In case of a hit, the opponent’s ship is destroyed.
○ In case of a miss, nothing happens.
● No two missiles should ever be fired at the same coordinates throughout the course
of the game.
● When all the ships of a particular player has been destroyed, he loses the game.
The following APIs have to be implemented:
Mandatory:
● initGame(N)

This will initialize the game with a battlefield of size NxN. Where the left half of
N/2xN will be assigned to PlayerA and the right half will be assigned to PlayerB
● addShip(id, size, x position PlayerA, y position PlayerA, x position PlayerB, y position
PlayerB)
This will add a ship of given size at the given coordinates in both the player’s
fleet.
● startGame()

This will begin the game, where PlayerA will always take the first turn. The output
of each step should be printed clearly in the console.
For eg.
PlayerA’s turn: Missile fired at (2, 4). “Hit”. PlayerB’s ship with id “SH1”
destroyed.
PlayerB’s turn: Missile fired at (6, 1). “Miss”

Optional
● viewBattleField()

This will display the battlefield as a NxN grid and all the ships along with the grids
occupied by each ship. PlayerA’s ship with id SH1 will be marked as A-SH1, with
id SH2 as A-SH2 and so on. Whereas PlayerB’s ships will be marked as B-SH1,
B-SH2 and so on.
Note: It should mark all the grids occupied by a ship and not just the center
coordinate.


✅ NxN battlefield
✅ Split battlefield for Player A & B
✅ Square ships
✅ No overlap
✅ Random firing without repetition
✅ Hit / Miss logic
✅ Game loop
✅ Clear console output
✅ Extensible OOP design
✅ Optional battlefield view

Battleship Game - Design Patterns Used
1) Factory : factory/ShipFactory Object creation Add new ship types
2) Strategy: display/, player/ Algorithm selection Add display modes, AI strategies
3) State: game/state/ Manage game flow, Add new game states
4) Facade: game/BattleshipGame , Simplify interface, Hide complexity
5) Template Method: player/Player, 

SOLID Principles Mapping
Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

✅ Cell - Manages single cell state
✅ Board - Manages grid of cells
✅ Ship - Manages ship state
✅ ShipFactory - Only creates ships
✅ DisplayStrategy - Only handles display

Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

✅ Player - Open for extension (HumanPlayer, ComputerPlayer, TerritorialPlayer)
✅ GameState - Open for new states
✅ DisplayStrategy - Open for new display modes
✅ Board - SharedBoard extends without modifying original

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

✅ Any Player subclass works in BattleshipGame
✅ Any DisplayStrategy implementation works
✅ Any GameState implementation works
✅ SharedBoard can replace Board where needed

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

✅ Small, focused interfaces: Ship, GameState, DisplayStrategy
✅ Classes only implement what they need
✅ No fat interfaces with unused methods

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

✅ High-level BattleshipGame depends on Player abstraction
✅ Cell depends on Ship interface, not concrete implementation
✅ All major classes depend on abstractions, not concretions
