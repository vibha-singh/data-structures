Both Union-Find (also known as Disjoint Set Union, or DSU) and DFS (Depth-First Search) are algorithms used to solve problems related to graphs, such as finding connected components, detecting cycles, or determining connectivity. However, they differ significantly in their approach, implementation, and use cases. Here's a detailed comparison:

1. Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union, DSU)
   **What It Does:**
   Union-Find is a data structure that keeps track of a partition of a set into disjoint subsets.
   It supports two main operations:
   **Find:** Determines which subset a particular element belongs to.
   
   **Union:** Merges two subsets into a single subset.

   **Use Cases:**
      Detecting cycles in an undirected graph.
      Finding connected components in a graph.
      Solving dynamic connectivity problems (e.g., adding edges and checking connectivity).
   
   **How It Works:**
   
      Each subset is represented as a tree, where one element is the root (representative) of the subset.
      Find: Traverses up the tree to find the root of the subset.
      Union: Merges two trees by attaching the root of one tree to the root of the other.
   
   **Optimizations:**
      **Path Compression:** Flattens the tree during find operations to make future queries faster.
      **Union by Rank/Size:** Attaches the smaller tree to the root of the larger tree during union operations to keep the tree balanced.
   
   **Time Complexity:**
      **Find:** Nearly O(1) with path compression and union by rank.
      **Union:** Nearly O(1) with path compression and union by rank.
   
   **Space Complexity:**
      O(V), where V is the number of vertices (to store parent and rank arrays).
   
   **Union Find Code:**
   `
   class UnionFind {
            int[] parent;
            int[] rank;

      public UnionFind(int n) {
         parent = new int[n];
         rank = new int[n];
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
               parent[i] = i; // Each node is its own parent initially
            }
      }
      /**
          The find method returns the root of the subset that x belongs to.
      **/
      public int find(int x) {
         if (parent[x] != x) {
            parent[x] = find(parent[x]); // Path compression
         }
            return parent[x];
      }
      public void union(int x, int y) {
         int rootX = find(x);
         int rootY = find(y);
         if (rootX != rootY) {
           // Union by rank: attach the smaller tree to the root of the larger tree
            if (rank[rootX] > rank[rootY]) {
                  parent[rootY] = rootX;
            } else if (rank[rootX] < rank[rootY]) {
                  parent[ ] = rootY;
            } else {
                  parent[rootY] = rootX;
                  rank[rootX]++; // Increase rank if both trees have the same depth 
            }
         }
      } 
       // Check if two elements belong to the same subset
       public boolean isConnected(int x, int y) {
            return find(x) == find(y);
       }
   }`

   **Explanation of the UnionFind Class**
       **Initialization:**
        The **parent** array stores the root (representative) of each subset.
        The rank array stores the depth of each subset (used for union by rank).
        Initially, each element is its own parent, and each subset has a rank of 1.
        
        **Find Operation:**
        The find method returns the root of the subset that x belongs to.
        It uses path compression to flatten the tree, making future queries faster.
        
        **Union Operation:**
        The union method merges the subsets containing x and y.
        It uses union by rank to attach the smaller tree to the root of the larger tree, keeping the tree balanced.
        
        **isConnected Operation:**
        The isConnected method checks if two elements belong q to the same subset by comparing their roots.

    **When to Use UnionFind**
        **Dynamic Connectivity:** When edges are added dynamically, and you need to check connectivity frequently.
        **Cycle Detection:** In undirected graphs.
        **Kruskal's Algorithm:** For finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST).

2. **DFS (Depth-First Search)**
    **What It Does:**
    DFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
    It is used to traverse or search a graph in a depthward motion.

    **Use Cases:**
    Finding connected components in a graph.
    Detecting cycles in a graph.
    Solving problems that require exploring all possible paths (e.g., backtracking problems).
    
    **How It Works:**
    Starts at a node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
    Uses a stack (either explicitly or implicitly via recursion) to keep track of nodes to visit.
    
    **Time Complexity:**
    O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
    
    **Space Complexity:**
    O(V) for the recursion stack or explicit stack.

    `public void dfs(int node, List<List<Integer>> graph, boolean[] visited) {
          visited[node] = true;
          for (int neighbor : graph.get(node)) {
             if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                dfs(neighbor, graph, visited);
             }
      }
    }`

4. **When to Use Which?**
    **Union-Find:**
    
    Use when you need to handle dynamic connectivity (e.g., adding edges and checking connectivity).
    Use for problems where you need to merge sets or detect cycles efficiently.
    Example: Kruskal's algorithm for Minimum Spanning Tree (MST).
    
    **DFS:**
    
    Use when you need to traverse or explore a graph (e.g., finding connected components, detecting cycles, or solving path-based problems).
    Use for problems where you need to explore all possible paths (e.g., backtracking problems).
    Example: Finding strongly connected components (SCCs) in a graph.
