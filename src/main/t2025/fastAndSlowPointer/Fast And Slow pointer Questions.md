The fast and slow pointer technique, also known as the "tortoise and hare" algorithm, is commonly used in problems involving linked lists, arrays, or sequences. Below is a list of common questions or problems that can be solved using this technique:

**Linked List Problems:**
Detect a Cycle in a Linked List
Determine if a linked list has a cycle.
Find the Starting Node of a Cycle in a Linked List
If a cycle exists, identify the node where the cycle begins.
Find the Middle of a Linked List
Locate the middle node of a linked list.
Check if a Linked List is a Palindrome
Determine if the linked list reads the same forwards and backwards.
Intersection of Two Linked Lists
Find the node where two linked lists intersect.
Remove the Nth Node from the End of a Linked List
Delete the nth node from the end of the list.
Reorder Linked List
Reorder the linked list in a specific pattern (e.g., L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln-1 → L2 → Ln-2 → …).
Detect and Remove Duplicates in a Sorted Linked List
Remove duplicate nodes from a sorted linked list.

**Array or Sequence Problems:**
Find the Duplicate Number in an Array
Given an array of integers where each integer is between 1 and n, find the duplicate number.
Find the Missing Number in a Sequence
Identify the missing number in a sequence of integers.
Find the Kth Element from the End of an Array
Locate the kth element from the end of an array.
Detect a Loop in a Circular Array
Determine if a circular array has a loop.
Find the Happy Number
Determine if a number is a "happy number" (a number that eventually reaches 1 when replaced by the sum of the squares of its digits).

**Other Problems:**
Detect a Cycle in a Graph
Determine if a directed or undirected graph contains a cycle.
Find the Length of the Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Use a variation of the fast and slow pointer technique to solve this problem.
Find the Majority Element in an Array
Identify the element that appears more than n/2 times in an array.
Detect a Loop in a Sequence Generated by a Function
Determine if a sequence generated by repeatedly applying a function has a cycle.
Find the Smallest Missing Positive Integer
Use a variation of the fast and slow pointer technique to solve this problem.
Detect a Cycle in a Number Sequence
Determine if a sequence of numbers generated by a mathematical operation has a cycle.
Find the Length of the Longest Palindromic Subsequence
Use a variation of the fast and slow pointer technique to solve this problem.
These problems often involve detecting cycles, finding middle points, or solving problems with two pointers moving at different speeds. The fast and slow pointer technique is efficient, typically operating in O(n) time with O(1) space complexity.
