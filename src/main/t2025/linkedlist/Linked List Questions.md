**Basic Operations**
    **Singly Linked List:**

    Reverse a Linked List.
    Find the middle of a Linked List.
    Detect a cycle in a Linked List.
    Merge two sorted Linked Lists.
    Remove duplicates from a sorted Linked List.
    Remove duplicates from an unsorted Linked List.
    Delete a node in a Linked List (given only the node pointer).
    Find the nth node from the end of a Linked List.
    Check if a Linked List is a palindrome.
    Swap nodes in a Linked List without swapping data.
    Pairwise swap elements of a Linked List.
    Rotate a Linked List by k places.
    Add two numbers represented by Linked Lists.

    Intersection point of two Linked Lists:

        **Approach**
        Calculate the Lengths of Both Lists:
        Traverse both linked lists to find their lengths.
        
        Align the Starting Points:
        Move the pointer of the longer list forward by the difference in lengths of the two lists. This ensures both pointers are the same distance from the intersection point.
        
        Traverse Both Lists Together:
        Move both pointers one step at a time.
        The node where they meet is the intersection point.

    **Doubly Linked List:**

    Reverse a Doubly Linked List.
    Find pairs with a given sum in a Doubly Linked List.
    Delete a node in a Doubly Linked List.

**Advanced Problems**
    **Cycle Detection and Related Problems:**
    Detect and remove a cycle in a Linked List.
    Find the starting point of a cycle in a Linked List.
    Find the length of a cycle in a Linked List:

    **Steps to Find the Length of a Cycle**
        1. Detect the Cycle:
            Use two pointers, slow and fast.
            Move slow one step at a time and fast two steps at a time.
            If they meet, a cycle exists.
        2. Calculate the Length of the Cycle:
            Once the cycle is detected, keep one pointer (slow or fast) at the meeting point.
            Use another pointer to traverse the cycle until it returns to the meeting point.
            Count the number of steps taken to complete the cycle.
