// Quickbooks helps small businesses with day-to-day operations. Intuit wants you to use company data from Quickbooks to discover relationships between companies in their networks.

// For example:

// CompanyA purchases dairy from CompanyB. CompanyB purchases pet feed from companyC.

// Company A (Grocery Store, address, etc) <--> Company B (Dairy Farm, address, etc) <--> Company C (Pet Feed Store, address, etc).

// A <--> B <--> C
 // A <--> E
// A <--> B <-->C
//     A<-->E<-->D<-->C

// E <--> F

// Deliver a feature for users that checks how many degrees of separation exist between two different businesses. For example, Business A regularly buys goods from Business B which regularly buys from Business C. A is one degree separated from C! The code must return the shortest path if there are multiple. Run your code with the example above. A <--> B <--> C Degree of separation between A & C is 1.
